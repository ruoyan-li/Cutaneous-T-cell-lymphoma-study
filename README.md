Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a potentially fatal clonal malignancy of T cells primarily affecting the skin. Lack of specific tumour markers for CTCL and its similarity to benign inflammatory skin diseases presents a diagnostic challenge, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis. We performed single cell transcriptome and T cell receptor profiling of CTCL skin and integrated these analyses with datasets from healthy skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis to reveal tumour-, patient- and stage-specific gene expression signatures of malignant T cells. Malignant T cells were patient-specific but a subset of these cells expressed a glycolytic gene programme across all donors. Early stage CTCL was characterised by cytotoxic and effector-like malignant T cell clones in contrast to the central memory-like clones within a Th2-permissive tumour microenvironment found in advanced CTCL. The CTCL microenvironment featured MHC-II+ fibroblast subsets reminiscent of lymphoid reticular zone fibroblasts and monocyte-derived DCs promoting a Th2-biased environment. Additionally, in CTCL lesions B cells form tertiary lymphoid structures associated with progressive disease that could serve as a novel histological hallmark for diagnosis and staging.
