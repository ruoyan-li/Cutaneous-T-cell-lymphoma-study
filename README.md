# Single-cell RNA sequencing study of Cutaneous T cell lymphoma

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a potentially fatal clonal malignancy of T cells primarily affecting the skin. CTCL patients often experience diagnostic delays and have limited treatment options as there are few studies on CTCL skin lesions to inform our understanding of disease pathogenesis at high resolution. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics profiling of CTCL skin and performed integrated comparative analysis with human skin cell atlas datasets from healthy skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We characterised features of CTCL that can aid diagnosis, inform disease pathogenesis and progression, and identify potential therapeutic strategies. Our findings show that CTCL tumour cells are preferentially Th2-like cells expressing glycolytic gene programmes. We identify MHC-II+ fibroblast subsets reminiscent of lymphoid reticular zone fibroblasts and monocyte-derived dendritic cells within the tumour microenvironment that support Th2-like tumour cells. CTCL Th2-like tumour cells are associated with B cells forming aggregates reminiscent of tertiary lymphoid structures, which are more prominent with progressive disease. We validated the prominence of B cells in CTCL skin infiltrates across three independent patient cohorts and demonstrated its utility as a novel histological hallmark for diagnosis, staging and as a therapeutic target.
